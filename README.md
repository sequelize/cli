Install this globally and you'll have access to the `sequelize` command anywhere on your system.

```
npm install -g sequelize-cli
```

or install it locally to your `node_modules` folder

```bash
npm install --save sequelize-cli
```
## Global Install Usage

```
$ sequelize [--HARMONY-FLAGS]
```


```
Sequelize [CLI: v0.0.4, ORM: v1.7.5]

## Local Install Usage

```
$ node_modules/.bin/sequelize [--HARMONY-FLAGS]
```

## Options

The manuals will show all the flags and options which are available for the respective tasks.
If you find yourself in a situation where you always define certain flags in order to
make the CLI compliant to your project, you can move those definitions also into a file called
`.sequelizerc`. The file will get `require`d if available and can therefore be either a JSON file
or a Node.JS script that exports a hash.

### Example for a Node.JS script

```javascript
var path = require('path')

module.exports = {
  'config':          path.resolve('config', 'database.json'),
  'migrations-path': path.resolve('db', 'migrate')
}
```

This will configure the CLI to always treat `config/database.json` as config file and
`db/migrate` as the directory for migrations.

### CoffeeScript support

The CLI is compatible with CoffeeScript. You can tell the CLI to enable that support via the `--coffee`
flag. Please note that you'll need to install `js2coffee` and `coffee-script` for full support.

### Configuration file

By default the CLI will try to use the file `config/config.json`. You can modify that path either via
the `--config` flag or via the option mentioned earlier. Here is how a configuration file might look
like (that's is the one that `sequelize init` generates:

```json
{
  "development": {
    "username": "root",
    "password": null,
    "database": "database_development",
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "dialect": "mysql"
  },
  "test": {
    "username": "root",
    "password": null,
    "database": "database_test",
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "dialect": "mysql"
  },
  "production": {
    "username": "root",
    "password": null,
    "database": "database_production",
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "dialect": "mysql"
  }
}
```

### Migration storage

By default the CLI will create a table in your database called `SequelizeMeta` containing an entry
for each executed migration.  Using `migrationStorage` in the configuration file you can have the
CLI create a JSON file which will contain an array with all the executed migrations.  You can
specify the path of the file using `migrationStoragePath` or the CLI will write to the file
`sequelize-meta.json`.

```json
{
  "development": {
    "username": "root",
    "password": null,
    "database": "database_development",
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "dialect": "mysql",
    "migrationStorage": "json",
    "migrationStoragePath": "sequelize-meta.json"
  }
}
```

If you want to keep the information in the database and like to configure the way it's stored,
you can choose from the following configuration possibilites:

```json
{
  "development": {
    // Use a different table name. Default: SequelizeMeta
    "migrationStorageTableName": "sequelize_meta"
  }
}
```

### Schema migration

Since v1.0.0 the CLI supports a new schema for saving the executed migrations. It will tell you about that
when you run a migration while having the old schema. You can opt-in for auto migrating the schema by adding a special property to your config file:

```json
{
  "development": {
    "autoMigrateOldSchema": true
  }
}
```

### The migration schema

The CLI uses [umzug](https://github.com/sequelize/umzug) and it's migration schema. This means a migration has too look like this:

```javascript
"use strict";

module.exports = {
  up: function(queryInterface, Sequelize, done) {
    done();
  },

  down: function(queryInterface) {
    return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
      resolve();
    });
  }
};
```

Please note that you can either return a Promise or call the third argument of the function once your asynchronous logic was executed. If you pass something to the callback function (the `done` function) it will be treated as erroneous execution.

Additional note: If you need to access the sequelize instance, you can easily do that via `queryInterface.sequelize`.
